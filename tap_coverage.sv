/*
Side Notes: 
Functional coverage in UVM allows you to observe and verify if all desired states and transitions in a design 
have been exercised. By defining coverage points and covergroups, we create a "map" of expected behavior. 
This can include transitions, specific states, or specific values of signals like TMS.

For the TAP controller:

We are interested in state transitions as the TMS signal controls them.
We define coverpoints for the STATE values and capture how each state transitions with different values of TMS.
We use cross-coverage to track transitions involving the current state and TMS.


1. Class Definition and Inheritance:
The tap_coverage class extends uvm_subscriber and links to tap_sequence_item, allowing it to observe 
transactions in the TAP state machine.

2. Covergroup Definition:
We create a covergroup called state_transition_cg with option.per_instance = 1. This option allows unique 
coverage per instance, useful if there are multiple TAP controllers in a system.

3. Coverpoints:
- State Coverpoint: The state coverpoint defines a bin for each possible state in the TAP state machine. 
    This lets us track whether each state has been visited at least once.
- TMS Coverpoint: The tms_val coverpoint monitors the TMS signal's value, recording each instance where TMS is 
    high (1) or low (0). 
    
4. Cross Coverage:
The state_x_tms cross coverage point captures all possible combinations of STATE and TMS. This ensures that 
transitions involving both STATE and TMS values are covered.

5. Sampling the Coverage:
The write method is invoked when a new sequence item is generated in the UVM environment.
state_transition_cg.sample(item); is called to sample the coverage data, logging the current state and TMS value.

This functional coverage will help ensure that every state and TMS condition combination in the TAP 
controllerâ€™s state machine is thoroughly tested.
